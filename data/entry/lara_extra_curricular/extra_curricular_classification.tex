\item {\itshape Legal Internship}: Any internship or summer work experience related to legal work, paralegal work, courts, or politics.
\item {\itshape Non-Legal Internship}: Any non-legal internship/summer work.
\item {\itshape Legal Work Experience}: Any full-time legal-related work experience.
\item {\itshape Non-Legal Work Experience}: Any full-time non-legal-related work experience.
